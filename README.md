### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anastasia, I'm from Moscow! ðŸ”­
I started studying web-development 3 years ago just to learn a new profession and earn my bread and butter. But when I understood the concept of IT I fell in love with the possibilities of this field. I enjoy learning new stuff globally and precisely. So currently I'm growing mostly as frontend-developer and for the last half a year as a backend-developer,but some day I'd love to try mobile-app and game development.
